## The situation

Soooo, I've been made redundant, oh dear. At the time of writing it's not quite official but it's looking like from December 15th I'll be unemployed.

I live in a village a few miles outside of Lincoln with my girlfriend (Becky), cat (Rudy) & dog (Gandalf). We've got a mortgage, a van (currently booked into the garage after it's most recent breaking down).

In light of the van situation, yesterday I determined to cycle to the coop to buy wine. On inspection I noticed the flat status of my bike tyres & leant the bike up against the front door to inflate them.
Halfway through the inflation the plastic handle snapped off the pump. At the same time Becky came outside to say the electrics in the kitchen were flickering on & off.

I successfully retrieved the wine on not quite pumped up tyres.

For the last nearly 5 years I've been working as a frontend / fullstack web developer, remotely since covid. Work has had it's ups and downs and honestly the redundancy thing feels like a bit of a relief.
I'm ready for a change but also "oh crap I need a job".

This job has been my first development job, I started as a junior frontend developer, mainly following designs and doing support type work. About 18 months ago I moved internally to a junior fullstack position. I feel like I've covered quite a lot of ground in that time but in all honesty I've found it tough and like many people struggled with imposter syndrome.

Since finding out about the redundancy I've been thinking quite a bit about what to do. It's definately my preference to get another developer job, however I don't want to rush into applying straight away. I'd like to take some time to work on my portfolio, get my confidence up again and find a job I'm excited about.

## Time & Money

My company is kindly not making me work my notice period of 6 weeks and I'll get a bit of a payout. We've also got a little in savings. The long and short of all that is that I'm in the fortunate position of being able to take 2-3 months before applying for jobs. With a bit of belt tightening we can _maaybe?_ survive 6 months without me getting another paycheck.

## The Loose Plan

Don't worry about work for 2-3 months, do some learning, fill in some gaps in my knowledge and make a portfolio. Maybe look for temp work around the time I start applying if things are going slowly to fend off destitution.

Spend some time on Gandalf (the dog), he's got a bit of reactivity issue with new / established enemy dogs. We've booked a reactivity course starting in the new year.

Get the sodding van fixed again, my mum gave us it after having endless problems & failing to get rid of it at auction, she was miss-sold it as an undeclared cat something write. We've sunk Â£2k into so far..but better the devil you know? It's our only vehicle & we can't afford anything else so stuck with it for now.

## The More Specific Plan

Make a portfolio, I used to have a small with 3-4 projects hosted on digital ocean. It was enough to get interviews last time around and pretty sure I can do better now. I'm now very aware of how everything takes so much longer than estimated so I want to be realistic and focussed. But also let myself follow my interests a bit and have fun.

Looking at what jobs are out there, the main things I want to learn are React & Typescript. I've done bit with Vue at work and have used React a little in the past, but not for a long time.

I also want to up my game with some fundamentals, css (I've bearly touched grid for example), vanilla js, accessibility, security & authentication.
